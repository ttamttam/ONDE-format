# Generalities

## Preamble

  The ONDE (**Open Non Destructive Evaluation**) format results from a joint intiative by COFREND and EPRI to define a specification of open and efficient NDE
  format in order to facilitate interoperability between softwares and to ensure ability to read the data in the long term. 
  This document is therefore a technical proposal to facilitate the establishment of a neutral and open format that can
  be a good candidate for a wide standardization effort.

  The objective that was assigned to this file format is to store ultrasonic raw data to be
  able to:

  * (re)analyse it, including ultrasonic metadata required for report generation, or
  * (re)use it for further data processing, or
  * achieve interoperability between acquisition systems and analysis software.

  The objective is neither to be able to (re)produce an acquisition setup nor to (re)create a
  simulation configuration from the ultrasonic data file alone. We define as raw data the data which is produced by
  the acquisition system (AScans, TFM images…).

  At this stage, it was decided to stick to the data acquired and the information that is necessary to
  perform an analysis. With a few exceptions, we did not add the information that is related to the analysis procedure
  itself (information related to the display, palette, etc…). This will be addressed in future stages (information
  related to analysis, reporting…).

- The Working Group has analysed several existing contributions as a working
  basis to define an open and standardized file format for ultrasonic
  testing. Formats coming from organisations (ECUF, MFMC, DICONDE, ANDE) and
  commercial products ( EVIDENT, TPAC, EDDYFI, SONATEST, CIVA) have been
  studied.  It was decided that the format would be based on the HDF5 framework,
  chosen for its well-established software ecosystem and its efficiency. The
  format proposal makes technical choices akin to those of the MFMC and ECUF
  format, and extends their possibilities in order to accommodate for a larger
  range of specimen geometries and types of data that are commonly encountered
  and were absent of the MFMC and ECUF specifications. In order to facilitate
  the migration from MFMC to ONDE, a compatibility with MFMC 2.0 specification
  has been added to the present specification.

- The format aims at finding the best compromise between two approaches: a very generic one with
  essentially raw geometric descriptions and a NDT oriented one with a representation of the objects familiar to the
  engineers. Considering that the transformation from NDT objects to the generic representation was straightforward, it
  was decided to systematically keep the generic representation and to allow to complement this representation with
  optional fields describing the objects in order to facilitate advanced analysis and visualisation. This approach was
  essentially adopted for three objects, namely the probe, the
  trajectory and the setup of the electronic laws.

- From an HDF5 structure perspective, architecture (flat or hierarchical) is not imposed. The relations between HDF5
  groups are translated into HDF5 references. The location of the HDF5 groups in the file is left open to the discretion of the implementor.
  The names of the groups is not imposed, the semantics of the group being defined by the mandatory ONDE:TYPE attribute. 
  Only ONDE:FILETYPE and ONDE:VERSION at hdf5 root level have a location that is  imposed in the file. 
  In order to allow the proposed file format to coexist with other hdf5 file formats, the raw data (
  arrays of signals or array of images which typically represents the vast majority of the file weight) can be anywhere
  in the file structure.

- All quantities are defined with SI units. Units are therefore expressed in meters, kilograms,
  seconds. However, degrees are used instead of radians.

## Tables legend

In the following sections, the data structure is described by blocks presented in tables.

Hereafter, when pointing to ECUF and MFMC, we refer to MFMC specification document 2.0.0b[^1] and ECUF 1.0[^2].

**Variables used in structure definition:**

Definitions (derived from MFMC 2.0.0b specification)

- Ultrasonic Element -- an ultrasonic transduction device that can be excited through an electric signal externally
  driven and/or that can reversely convert ultrasound into a signal
- Ultrasonic Probe -- a collection of ultrasonic elements that are assembled together so that their relative positions
  and orientations are fixed during the acquisition process -- note that probes that possess the ability to adapt to the
  surface during the acquisition are not handled in this version of the specification
- Specimen -- object which is the subject of the inspection
- Frame -- position and orientation of a given object related to an acquisition
- Probe Element Combination (PEC) -- the system used within an MFMC structure to identify a specific element in a
  specific probe, comprising an HDF5 reference to the probe group and the index of an element in that probe;
- Focal law -- a set of instructions that specify how one or more PECs are used together;
- Transmit focal law -- a focal law relating to transmission of ultrasound from one or more PECs;
- Receive focal law -- a focal law relating to reception of ultrasound from one or more PECs;
- A-Scan -- a time-domain, ultrasonic signal (comprising amplitude measurements regularly sampled in time at a specified
  sampling frequency) that is recorded for a combination of transmit focal law and receive focal law; this can be used
  to represent both summed signals and elementary channels
- DataFrame -- a collection of coherent data obtained for a particular triggering event consisting of one of the
  following:
    - A-scans obtained using different transmit and receive focal laws for each A-scan;
    - Reconstructed images corresponding to specific reconstruction zones
    - Scalar data (peak-related or corresponding to particular post-treatments)
- Dataset -- a collection of dataframes in which all acquisition parameters are fixed from one dataframe to another;
- Ultrasonic time -- timescale over which an individual ultrasonic A-scan is recorded, which is assumed to be
  instantaneous compared to timescale associated with mechanical movement of probes;
- Propagation line -- string of connected segments representing the ultrasonic propagation for a given focal law;
- Trajectory -- set of frames representing the different position of a device;
- Acquisition grid -- particular trajectory corresponding to a cartesian grid located at the surface of a plane or
  cylindrical component;
- Image zone -- 2D or 3D regular cartesian grid used to define the reconstruction points creating the images during a
  TFM or PWI-like acquisition;

*Figure 1: Relationships between the different blocks in the data model*

The ONDE format introduces an inheritance mechanism in order to specify the attributes that are mandatory and optional for a given group.
The diagram in Figure 1 explains the relationships between the different blocks in the data model in an UML style.

Three blocks type contain the data: namely, Ascan, Tscan and CScan (peak-like) blocks. Ascans can be used either to
describe summed signals or elementary channels data. For Cscan block, it is possible to keep the track to the raw data (
either Tscan or Ascan) from which the Cscan data originates. For Tscan blocks, it is possible to keep the track to the
elementary channels. A link to the setup can be specified: it is attached to the raw data if it is available, to the
post-processed data (Cscan or Tscan) otherwise.

The setup description is organized in two blocks defining the ultrasonic setup and the geometric setup. In the
ultrasonic setup we find the description of the electronic settings, with blocks describing the emitter and receive laws
and the phased array setup for acquisition with multielement transducers.

The geometric setup contains the dynamic description of the scene: inspected component, probes and acquisition
trajectories. It is possible to define different trajectories for different probes or to have probes sharing the same
trajectory, offsets retrieving the set of different probe positions from the trajectory.

## HDF5 implementation

### Relationship between the HDF5 implementation and the data model

The mechanisms used in the ONDE specification to map the data model specification to the HDF5 implementation are described above.

### Entry points for navigating files in the UT implementation

The blocks defined in the general structure are implemented as HDF5 groups, the
name of which is free but which have a mandatory 'ONDE:TYPE' attribute that
defines their nature. The entry points are the xxx_DATASET_yyy groups (namely
groups that have as a ONDE:TYPE attribute ONDE_DATASET_UT_ASCAN,
ONDE_DATASET_UT_TSCAN or ONDE_DATASET_UT_CSCAN)

When discovering the content of a given file, the following procedure must therefore be applied:

- Read the 'ONDE_FILETYPE' and 'ONDE_VERSION' attributes at root level and verify the compatibility of the version number with the
  reader, and that the type is that of a UT ONDE file ('ONDE_UT')
- Read all groups in the file and identify the groups corresponding to the datasets blocks by checking
  which groups have a 'TYPE' attribute whose value is 'ONDE_DATASET_UT_ASCAN', 'ONDE_DATASET_UT_TSCAN', 'ONDE_DATASET_UT_CSCAN'.
- From there follow the HDF5 references defined in the specification to retrieve the data arrays, the related datasets, the
  setup information…

## Definition of frames

### 3D Frames

Figure 2 displays the different frames and convention involved in the positioning systems. The PCF (Probe Coordinate
Frame) is the frame that is related to a specific probe or set of probes. It can be arbitrarily chosen to be centered
along the piezoelectric cell, the index point, the carrier system, the Probe Center Separation for TOFD systems, etc.
Through a rigid-body offset, it is related to the Trajectory Frame (TF), which for a given position is defined in
relation to the Reference Frame. The list of these positions are defined in an Acquisition Trajectory block.

The components frames are defined in the Reference Frame.

![Different frames and convention involved in the positioning systems](../images/media/frames_conventions.png "Figure 2")

*Figure 2: Different frames and convention involved in the positioning systems*

In the document, it was chosen to define the transformation between two frames in the shape of a vector consisting of 7
values: 3 for the offset in terms of x,y,z directions, 4 for the rotation defining the frame expressed in terms of
quaternions. The definition of rotations through quaternions was chosen because of its compactness and the absence of
ambiguity (as opposed to Euler angles which require defining an ordering of the directions).

The Wikipedia pages related to quaternion and rotation matrices provide formulae for the transition from the quaternion
shape to rotation matrices and the reverse operation: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Quaternion>.

Throughout the document, a frame is provided for the following objects:

- The specimen frame,
- The trajectory frames (a frame for each position in the trajectory)
- The probe coordinate frames
- The elements
- The TFM Zones
- The index points

The diagram displayed in Figure 3 defines the hierarchy between these frames:

*Figure 3: Hierarchy of the frames used for the geometric representation of the objects*

### 2D Frames

In order to refer to frames on unfolded 2D surfaces, we introduce the following transformation: the transformation
between frame (O,u,v) and (O',u',v') is expressed in the (O,a,b) frame by the (∆a,∆b,α) triplet.

# Appendix A -- conversion from quaternions to matrices

when dealing with 3D orientations, to define the quaternion corresponding to the orientation of one reference frame
relative to another, we need the following formula to calculate the components of a quaternion, q, from the elements of
a rotation matrix, R:

$q_{1} = \ \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{1 + r_{1,1} + r_{2,2} + r_{3,3}}$

$q_{2} = \ \frac{1}{2}sign(r_{3,2} - r_{2,3)}$$\sqrt{1 + r_{1,1} - r_{2,2} - r_{3,3}}$

$q_{3} = \ \frac{1}{2}sign(r_{1,3} - r_{3,1)}$$\sqrt{1 - r_{1,1} + r_{2,2} - r_{3,3}}$

$q_{4} = \ \frac{1}{2}sign(r_{2,1} - r_{1,2)}$$\sqrt{1 - r_{1,1} - r_{2,2} + r_{3,3}}$

Where

$$R\ = \ \begin{pmatrix}
r_{1,1} & r_{1,2} & r_{1,3} \\
r_{2,1} & r_{2,2} & r_{2,3} \\
r_{3,1} & r_{3,2} & r_{3,3}
\end{pmatrix}$$

If q is the unit quaternion corresponding to the rotation matrix R, then -q is the other quaternion corresponding to the
same orientation.

Similarly, if you have a unit quaternion q and want to convert it to a rotation matrix R, the formula is:

$$R\ = \ \begin{pmatrix}
2q_{1}^{2} + 2q_{2}^{2} - 1 & 2q_{2}q_{3} - 2q_{1}q_{4} & 2q_{2}q_{4} + 2q_{1}q_{3} \\
2q_{2}q_{3} + 2q_{1}q_{4} & 2q_{1}^{2} + 2q_{3}^{2} - 1 & 2q_{3}q_{4} - 2q_{1}q_{2} \\
2q_{2}q_{4} - 2q_{1}q_{3} & 2q_{3}q_{4} + 2q_{1}q_{2} & 2q_{1}^{2} + 2q_{4}^{2} - 1
\end{pmatrix}$$
